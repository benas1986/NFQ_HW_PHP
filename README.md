# Second Homework at NFQ academy

`Repository` `PHP classes` `PHP magic methods` `Composer`  `Namespaces`  `Autoloader PSR-4` 

## Workflow

    1. Create new GITHUB repository. Put all work into it.
    2. Create few classes with all PHP magic methods. On the other file show how to work these methods.
    3. Create few classes in folders (at least 3 levels deep). Use Namespaces.
    4. Create autoloader PSR-4 (dont use composer). Show how it works on created classes. 
    5. Send GITHUB repository link to your lecturer.
